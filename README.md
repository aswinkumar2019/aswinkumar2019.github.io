SORRY THIS PROJECT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE ON NEW BROWSER VERSIONS.
This project is made for scratch version 2.

Note:
I have created this readme file for reference during the amazon interview the day before.Please apologize if unable to understand :)
Platform: JAVASCRIPT in a browser
Language: JS
Services used:

AWS Rekognition: We used it to create collection,store faces,compare faces in collection,object detection etc.
AWS polly: Text to speech
AWS S3: To store images,documents in case of Document AI
AWS transcribe: Didnt use yet.but good speech to text api which we planned to use later.
AWS tranlate: To translate between different languages with different voices.

We just import the code url into scratchx website and,each js function will convert into blocks.
Kids can just drag and drop blocks to experience AWS AI services.
We even extended these to google and azure services.
COOL :)

Thanks to Ceyhun,who helped me with his code where he used single aws service.
Inspired from that,i extended it to multiple services.
Seeing how his code was deployed in goverment school he was really happy :)

I shall update this readme later.Thanks
